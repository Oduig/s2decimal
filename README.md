# Decimal Clock for Gear S2

Are you tired of time unit conversions?
Do you prefer to start counting at 0?
Can you be the change you want to see in the world?

Then Decimal Clock is the watch face for you. The first watch face for Gear S2 to use Decimal Time.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time

Thousands of years ago, the Egyptians liked counting in base 12. Around the same time, Babylonians thought that was simplistic and decided they would use base 60 instead. Since then, we have made the equally arbitrary decision to go with base 10. 
Luckily, after all those years we have developed metric units that actually make sense. And let's be honest, if you had to measure the area of a farm, would you think of using 43560 square shoes?
But one of the biggest numerical crimes lies in time itself. Hours, minutes and seconds are so unbelievably arbitrary that any man who suggested it today would be put in a mental facility! So let's call the people to arms, and end this madness once and for all!



(If you just want to fool your friends with this watch face, we will begrudgingly accept you as well.)
